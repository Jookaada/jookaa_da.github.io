      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name's Nuno, I'm a Computer Science student at FCUL, in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
      <p>There's not much about me. Open source all the way, pituresque stuff, sometimes I smell like coffee and I'd love to to actually give a bit of a shit about code optimization, but that's for later. When everything ACTUALLY works. I also like to play video games, watch series and anime and end up having to do stuff with a really</p>
      <p>I'm pretty advanced with C, have little experience with Python, and have some fluency in Java, PHP and VB .NET. I've been interested in practicing a lot with different languages to keep my head straight and be able to code without having to remember how to do something in a certaing language because I end up forgetting some of the little quirks of certain language's syntaxes, but whatever: college isn't helping with the lack of time either.</p>
      <p>As a great philosopher once said: "On open source, it is a way to be more independent and less dependant on megacorps." The reiteration was unnecessary, but this is a whole can of worms I'll open some other time.</p>
      <p>Don't come to me for aesthetics: if you're looking at this website, you kind of understand why I'm saying this. I eat up that stylish ass <b><a href="https://jiaxinwen.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/the-ui-design-of-persona-5/" style="text-decoration:none; color:white;">Persona 5 UI Design</a></b> but I go back and forth as well with stupid <b style="color:#00FF00">1337 h4x0r</b> phases, vaporwav e, phases, and mostly, I abide by my Coffee Color Scheme which uses the colors <a style="background-color: #666666"><b style="color:#0E0504">#0E0504</b>, <b style="color:#794028">#794028</b>, <b style="color:#BE7656">#BE7656</b>, <b style="color:#4B1F0E">#4B1F0E</b> and <b style="color:#EFC3A4">#EFC3A4</b></a>. I use it a lot on a big ammount of the stuff I work on and, depending on visitor feedback, I might even replace the color scheme of this website with it as well.</p>
      <p>I don't talk politics. It's not worth my time. It's a saddistic game made by people who like seeing others angry. Just because I don't talk about it, doesn't mean it does not exist, but I want to avoid having to discuss this stuff, since we've gotten to the point where people will praise each other for doing or saying the bare minimum. <strong>If you expected to find stuff like that on my Twitter, you can also give up.</strong> I don't turn my nose up to naive and impressionable children whose political alignment changes every week.</p>
      <p>I'll be using this little spot to document some projects and whatnot. Updates coming soon.</p>
